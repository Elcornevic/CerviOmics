# Highlights 

1. CMSN tumors with high TMB showed worse prognosis, unlike SCC and AC subtypes. 

2. KIT and ROS1 mutations differed across HPV+ cervical cancer subtypes. 

3. PIK3CA hotspot mutations clustered in PI3Ka I domain across all CC subtypes. 

4. 3q26 amplification was a shared alteration with diagnostic and prognostic value. 

4. KRAS mutations were enriched in adenocarcinomas but absent in squamous tumors.
