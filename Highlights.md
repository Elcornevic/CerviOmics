# Highlights 

1. CMSN tumors with high TMB showed worse prognosis, unlike SCC and AC subtypes. 

2. _KIT_ and _ROS1_ mutations differed across HPV+ cervical cancer subtypes. 

3. _PIK3CA_ hotspot mutations clustered in PI3Ka I domain across all CC subtypes. 

4. 3q26 amplification was a shared alteration with diagnostic and prognostic value. 

5. _KRAS_ mutations were enriched in adenocarcinomas but absent in squamous tumors.
